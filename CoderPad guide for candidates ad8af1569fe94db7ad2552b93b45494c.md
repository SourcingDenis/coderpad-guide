# CoderPad guide for candidates

CoderPad is a platform for doing technical phone screens or remote interviews in the browser. A pad is similar to common Integration Development Environments (IDEs). You write code in the left-hand pane, run code with the ‘Run’ button, and view output in the right-hand pane. The right pane also includes an interactive Read–Evaluate–Print Loop (REPL) for some [language](https://coderpad.io/languages/). The **Reset** button clears the output in the right pane, while the code you’ve written in the left pane remains intact.

> ✅ Preparation PROtip: One of the best ways to prepare for a CoderPad interview or take-home test is to use the sandbox environment, which you can access below:

# **Assessment types**

CoderPad supports two types of assessments, *live interviews* and *take-home projects*.

[**Take-home projects**](CoderPad%20guide%20for%20candidates%20ad8af1569fe94db7ad2552b93b45494c/Take-home%20projects%20a45174abd73c42a8bd0a1a14a0f0b4ff.md)

You will receive a CoderPad link to the project. Click on the link to see detailed instructions about the task, including the amount of time you have to complete it. The project starts once you enter the CoderPad environment. You can start coding immediately. The amount of time you have left appears in the bottom left-hand corner.

When you are ready, submit your code by clicking the **Submit Take Home** button at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. If you don’t complete the challenge within the allotted time, your code will be submitted when the time runs out.

[**Live interviews**](CoderPad%20guide%20for%20candidates%20ad8af1569fe94db7ad2552b93b45494c/Live%20interviews%20e7b64413f9674d958607a149a8943813.md)

You will receive a CoderPad link prior to your interview. At the scheduled time, open the link, input your name, and join the interview. Your interviewer may have you connect via a video call, which you can do by selecting the **Start Call** button in the bottom left corner of the pad.

# Useful tips

### **Programming languages and testing**

We support most programming languages, many with autocomplete functions. We also have unit testing suites and other packages and libraries. See our [languages](https://coderpad.io/languages/) page for more details.

For the languages that support autocomplete, you may need to toggle autocomplete to “Enabled” from the *Settings* menu during your interview if you want it. To access language information during your interview, click the **Info** button next to the language name at the top of your pad.

### **Customising editor settings**

Click the **Settings** button in the lower-right corner to customize settings, such as code autocompletion for supported languages, [bracket auto-closure](https://coderpad.io/resources/docs/pads/code-editor/), unique tab size, larger font size, lighter color theme, and to change your key bindings from normal to Vim or Emacs.

Most settings are disabled by default. Changing your settings does not affect your interviewer’s settings.

> ✅ You can find the Emacs key mappings here and the Vim key mappings here. Please note that they cannot be custom mapped at this time.

### **Drawing Mode**

Interviewers may enable *Drawing Mode* in a pad to describe a system or diagram an architecture. For more detailed instructions on using Drawing Mode [check out our user guide](https://coderpad.io/resources/docs/drawing-mode/).

### **Try it out ahead of time!**

You can try out CoderPad in this embedded sandbox:

> ✅ CoderPad supports common IDE keyboard shortcuts. The full list can be found here.
> 

Each company creates their own interview questions, so there are no practice questions on our site.

We do encourage you to try out the [sandbox](https://coderpad.io/sandbox/) environment which gives you a CoderPad session that is nearly identical to a real CoderPad interview – minus the multi-user functions and the ability to save the session.

# FAQs

### **Does CoderPad auto-close brackets?**

Auto-close brackets is disabled by default, but you can enable it using the Settings menu. Look for “Settings” in the bottom right corner of any pad or in the Sandbox.

### **Do you have emacs?**

Yes! Look for “Settings” in the bottom right corner of any pad or in the Sandbox.

### **Do you have Vim mode?**

Yes! You can enable Vim mode using the Settings menu. Look for “Settings” in the bottom right corner of any pad or in the Sandbox.

### **Do you have code autocompletion for [language]?**

Check out the language you’re interested in on our [Languages](https://coderpad.io/languages/) page – we specify whether autocomplete is enabled.

### **Do candidates have to register an account or pay to use CoderPad?**

Candidates never have to register or pay to participate in a CoderPad interview. You also have unlimited use of our free practice [Sandbox](https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox).

### **Does CoderPad have any other color schemes?**

Yes! CoderPad defaults to Dark mode, but you can switch to Light mode from the settings menu. Look for “Settings” in the bottom right corner of any pad or in the Sandbox.

### **Are there any built-in practice questions for candidates?**

No, companies each provide their own questions for CoderPad interviews so there is no existing database of questions. We recommend you check out the getting started guide for candidates at the bottom of this page to prepare for your upcoming interview. Good luck!

### **Can I change the font or tab size in CoderPad?**

Yes! Look for “Settings” in the bottom right corner of any pad or in the Sandbox.

### **What are the memory, disk, or network limits placed on pad containers?**

Currently, containers are given 512mb of RAM, and the equivalent of two cores for 5 seconds, and one core thereafter. Data transmitted by your program over the internet is limited to 0.75mb.

### **Why wasn’t I able to run code during an interview?**

Some companies disable code execution during an interview to reduce emphasis on fixing minor typos, and instead focus on big picture thinking. If you see only one pane instead of two and “Execution Disabled” in the top left corner, that means code execution is disabled.
